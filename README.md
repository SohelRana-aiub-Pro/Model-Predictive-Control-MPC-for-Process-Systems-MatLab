Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an advanced control methodology widely used in industrial
automation and process systems. Unlike traditional controllers, MPC predicts future system behavior
using a mathematical model and optimizes control inputs accordingly. This project demonstrates the
implementation of MPC for a first-order plus dead-time (FOPDT) process system using Octave,
without relying on external packages. The goal is to showcase MPC's ability to track setpoints,
handle disturbances, and respect input constraints.
